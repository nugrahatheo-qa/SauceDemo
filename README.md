🧪 **About the Project**

Imagine a simple-looking e-commerce site — clean, minimal, and fast. But beneath the surface, there could be bugs waiting to disrupt the user experience. That’s where I come in, stepping into the role of a Manual QA Engineer.

This project is a full end-to-end QA simulation based on SauceDemo, a public e-commerce demo site often used for QA training. I used it as the foundation to build a complete QA portfolio, simulating what a real-world QA process would look like.

My goals were to:

- Practice real-world manual testing workflows.

- Create professional QA documentation such as test plans, test cases, bug reports, and test summaries.

- Strengthen my ability to find and report bugs clearly and effectively.

The testing scope includes core user flows like login, browsing products, adding to cart, checkout, and logout — tested using both functional and negative test techniques.

📚 **What I Did in This Project**

🔍 Analysis & Planning
Started by drafting a comprehensive Test Plan outlining the scope, strategy, and exit criteria of the testing process.

🧪 Manual Test Case Creation
Designed detailed test cases covering both positive and negative scenarios. Each test case is written in a clean, reusable format.

🐞 Bug Reporting Simulation
Identified and documented potential bugs using a structured bug reporting format similar to tools like Jira.

📊 Test Summary Report
After test execution, I compiled a summary report that includes results, metrics, and insights from the testing.

📁 Organized Portfolio Structure
Packaged all deliverables into a clean folder structure suitable for showcasing in interviews, portfolios, and GitHub.

🎯 **Why This Matters**

This project demonstrates that QA isn’t just about finding bugs — it’s about protecting the user experience. Through this realistic, hands-on project, I show that I’m ready to contribute as a QA Intern or Junior QA Engineer in a real product environment.

If you're a beginner QA or someone looking to build your first portfolio, I hope this inspires and guides you.
If you're a recruiter or mentor, I hope this gives you insight into my hands-on approach and documentation skills.
